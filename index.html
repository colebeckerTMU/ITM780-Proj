        <h2 class="mainTitle">Data Analysis</h2>
        <p class="stext">Throughout my professional career, I have been responsible for the delivery of many initiatives
            that involved quantitative analysis. Below is a non-exhaustive list of some of the highlights:
        <ul class="listfix">
            <li>At Samsung, I leveraged historical data to perform predictive analytics on the upcoming Q4 to determine product price and supply.</li>
            <li>At Shoppers Drugmart, I combined a variety of data to create a consumer pricing index. This enabled management to efficiently
                look at price in a given location or region at various levels of granularity.</li>
            <li>At Moneris, I leveraged market research and insider information to determine trends in the ecommerce
                space to prepare a report for the CEO at the time. </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <h2 class="mainTitle">Business Solutions</h2>
        <p class="stext">
            As I learn and develop as a professional, I look to combine my experience across all of my roles to create the most value in whichever
            present role I'm in.<br><br> Currently, I'm working towards adding automation into a traditional company. Leveraging machine learning, Python,
            SQL, and a learned knowledge of APIs, I am helping to remove mundane processes and free up those who were once doing these activities. I have 
            three goals for this project:
            <ul>
                <li> Increase productivity for the organization. </li>
                <li> Increase overall work satisfaction </li> 
                <li> Develop my skills in the information systems consulting space.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

            <h2 class="mainTitle">Entrepreneurial Indeavors</h2>
            <p class="stext">
                As the child of two entrepreneurs, I have been exposed to the idea of working for myself my entire life. This has not manifest itself in any
                particular way. However, it has enabled me to move through life with a unique lens on things I learn, work on, and develop. I like the idea of
                being able to develop my interests into projects or products that can be potentially financially viable.<br><br> More to come in this respect.
